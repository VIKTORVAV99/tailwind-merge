# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are available for the two latest major versions.

In the event of a security vulnerability in tailwind-merge, a patch release with a fix will be made to all affected latest major versions. I.e. if the two latest major versions of tailwind-merge would be `v9.3.4` and `v8.10.0` and a security vulnerability would get discovered which affected all versions from `v6.0.0` to `v9.3.4`, then at least the releases `v9.3.5` and `v8.10.1` would be made to fix the security vulnerability.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub at https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/security.

You can expect an answer from me within 24 hours most of the time. However, if I'm travelling and don't have good reception, it could take up to a few days. Usually I set my GitHub status to busy when I expect to be unresponsive for more than a day.
